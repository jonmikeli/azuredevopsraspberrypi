# Azure DevOps fashioned Raspberry PI 3B+ Case


![Raspberry PI 3B+ Azure DevOps case](images/case.jpg)


You will find in this repository the **FBX** files for 3D printing a Raspberry PI 3B+ Case.
A Visual Studio / DevOps theme has been used in order to build an [Azure DevOps project](https://jmidotnetfr.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/vsts-global-dashboard-1-the-beginning/)(Azure DevOps UWP dashboards on Windows IoT Core).

This work is based in the model published [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:922740).

> [!NOTE]
>
> The case has been reviewed to add room enough to host an internal fan.
> A few adjustments over the USB ports are needed to make the case perfect.
> The first version was created with the current design thinking in providing room but after a few tests, filling up the empty spaces is probably better.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This case is for Raspberry PI 3B+ and compatible models.
> If you want to use it for Raspberry PI 4, the design needs to be updated.
